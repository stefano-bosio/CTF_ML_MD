This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and databases for the course "Metodi simulativi e di Machine Learning in chimica farmaceutica".

The notebooks can be run locally on your computer or in Google Colab. 

To run the notebooks locally, you need to have a Python environment set up with the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file (that will be added soon).
